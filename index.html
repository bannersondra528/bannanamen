  <section id="approach">
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>We approach each project with curiosity, intention, and respect for the space’s history and future. No two spaces — and no two clients — are the same, which is why our work is never formulaic. We begin by listening: to your story, your goals, and your lifestyle.</p>
    <p>Through collaboration and careful refinement, we craft environments that feel lived-in, layered, and enduring. Our process is transparent and grounded, ensuring that every choice — from big-picture concepts to finishing touches — aligns with your needs and the soul of the space.</p>
